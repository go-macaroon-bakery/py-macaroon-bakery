    All macaroons are associated with one or more operations (see
    the Op type) which define the capabilities of the macaroon.

    There is one special operation, "login" (defined by LOGIN_OP) which grants
    the capability to speak for a particular user.
    The login capability will never be mixed with other capabilities.

    It is up to the caller to decide on semantics for other operations.
