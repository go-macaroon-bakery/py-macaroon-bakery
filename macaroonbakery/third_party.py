    that created the third party caveat.

    :param: third_party_key_pair holds the nacl private used to decrypt
    the caveat - the key pair of the discharging service.

    :param: root_key bytes holds the secret root key encoded by the caveat.

    :param: caveat holds the full encoded base64 string caveat id from
    which all the other fields are derived.

    :param: version holds the version that was used to encode
    the caveat id.

    :param: id holds the id of the third party caveat (the id that the
    discharge macaroon should be given). This will differ from Caveat
    when the caveat information is encoded separately.

    :param: namespace object that holds the namespace of the first party
    that created the macaroon, as encoded by the party that added the
    third party caveat.
